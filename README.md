# react-epaper
A small and simple viewer made in React that takes a pdf and displays it like a newspaper.

## How to use
Just set the "src" attribute of the EPAPER component to your file path and the "length" attribute to the number of sites your pdf has.

## Example
<a href="https://epaper.mystyx.de" target="_blank">epaper.mystyx.de</a>
